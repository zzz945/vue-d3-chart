## What is this
A interactive chart library based on vue and d3
## Look at the demo
[DEMO](https://zzz945.github.io/vue-d3-chart/)
## Why do this but not using other chart library like C3
Config other chart library like C3 to fit our needs is too complicated. If you have a lot of data visualization needs in your work, I recommend you write your own chart library. Vue and D3 is popular awesome, if you are familier with them, you can write
your own chart library based on this project.
## Develop your own chart library (Recommended)
```
1.  Fork this project
2.  git clone ‘your forked project’
3.  cd vue-d3-chart
4.  npm install
5.  npm run dev
```
## Or you can (Unavailable due to being under development)
```
npm install vue-d3-chart
```
